## MetaDreams

### Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a command-line interface (CLI) application that reads metadata from PNG files generated with an AI and exports this metadata to an XML file. In order to achieve this goal, a number of tasks and challenges must be addressed.

#### Tasks and Challenges

- Parsing the metadata from the PNG files: One of the first tasks in this project will be to find a way to extract the metadata from the PNG files and store it in a structured format. This could involve using a library or tool that is specifically designed for reading metadata from PNG files, or implementing this functionality from scratch.

- Storing the metadata in a suitable data structure: Once the metadata has been extracted from the PNG files, it will need to be stored in a data structure that is suitable for use in the application. This could involve creating a class or set of classes that represent the metadata and the relationships between different pieces of metadata.

- Generating the XML file: In order to export the metadata to an XML file, the application will need to generate an XML document that contains the metadata in a structured format. This could involve using a library or tool that is specifically designed for generating XML files, or implementing this functionality from scratch.

- Handling command-line arguments: The CLI application will need to be able to accept command-line arguments that specify the input and output files, as well as any other options or parameters that the application may need. This will require implementing a way to parse these arguments and use them to control the behavior of the application.

#### Conclusion

In summary, building a CLI application that reads metadata from PNG files and exports it to an XML file involves a number of tasks and challenges related to parsing and storing the metadata, generating the XML file, and handling command-line arguments. Careful planning and attention to detail will be required in order to successfully complete these tasks and achieve the overall goal of the project.
